        <h1>NF<br> <span>Let You Down.</span></h1>
        <p>Feels like we're on the edge right now <br>
            I wish that I could say I'm proud<br>
            I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
            Let you down<br>
            All these voices in my head get loud<br>
            I wish that I could shut them out<br>
            I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
            L-l-let you down<br>
            Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment<br>
            Doing everything I can, I don't wanna make you disappointed<br>
            It's annoying<br>
            I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever did wasn't ever tryna make an issue for you<br>
            But, I guess the more you<br>
            Thought about everything, you were never even wrong in the first place, right?<br>
            Yeah, I'ma just ignore you<br>
            Walking towards you, with my head down, lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you<br>
            Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time? That's parents for you<br>
            Very loyal?<br>
            Shoulda had my back, but you put a knife in it, my hands are full<br>
            What else should I carry for you?<br>
            I cared for you, but<br>
            Feels like we're on the edge right now<br>
            I wish that I could say I'm proud<br>
            I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
            L-l-let you down<br>
            All these voices in my head get loud<br>
            I wish that I could shut them out<br>
            I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
            L-l-let you down<br>
            Yeah, you don't wanna make this work<br>
            You just wanna make this worse<br>
            Want me to listen to you<br>
            But you don't ever hear my words<br>
            You don't wanna know my hurt, yet<br>
            Let me guess you want an apology, probably<br>
            How can we keep going at a rate like this?<br>
            We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave<br>
            Please don't come after me<br>
            I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all<br>
            Go ahead, just drink it off<br>
            Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong<br>
            Ain't that what you always do?<br>
            I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood<br>
            What else can I offer you?<br>
            There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you<br>
            Feels like we're on the edge right now<br>
            I wish that I could say I'm proud<br>
            I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
            L-l-let you down<br>
            All these voices in my head get loud<br>
            I wish that I could shut them out<br>
            I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
            L-l-let you down<br>
            Yeah, don't talk down to me<br>
            That's not gonna work now<br>
            Packed all my clothes and I moved out<br>
            I don't even wanna go to your house<br>
            Everytime I sit on that couch<br>
            I feel like you lecture me<br>
            Eventually, I bet that we<br>
            Could have made this work and probably woulda figured things out<br>
            But I guess that I'm a letdown<br>
            But it's cool, I checked out<br>
            Oh, you wanna be friends now?<br>
            Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now<br>
            Sit around and talk about the good times<br>
            That didn't even happen<br>
            I mean, why are you laughing?<br>
            Must have missed that joke<br>
            Let me see if I can find a reaction<br>
            No, but at least you're happy<br>
            Feels like we're on the edge right now<br>
            I wish that I could say I'm proud<br>
            I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
            Oh, I let you down<br>
            All these voices in my head get loud<br>
            And I wish that I could shut them out<br>
            I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
            Oh, let you down<br>
            I'm sorry<br>
            I'm so sorry now<br>
            I'm sorry<br>
            That I let you down.</p>
